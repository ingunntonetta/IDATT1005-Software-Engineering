## 4 Document handling

#### 4.1 GitLab

Primarily, all documents should be uploaded to GitLab, where each individual should also have a local copy of the repository. This entails redundancy, resulting in a total of 4 local copies, along with one in the cloud. We see this as prudent planning for potential technical issues beyond our control, such as cloud server problems.

#### 4.2 Other Documents

This involves the handling of spreadsheets and diagrams, such as time tracking and Gantt charts. We will use appropriate programs for design and management, primarily the Microsoft 365 suite. Regular backups will also be taken here, ensuring an updated local version is available even if the cloud data is lost.
